# Impact Hub Governance
The Internet of Impact Hub ("ImpactHub") has an on-chain governance mechanism for passing text proposals, changing consensus parameters, and spending funds from the community pool.

This repository provides background information on these different kinds of proposals and best-practices for drafting them and proposing them on-chain. It also provides a place for collaborating on draft proposals in plain text on Github.

If you'd like to draft a proposal, start here. See the contents below for more background on the governance system, the different types of proposals, and how to submit one.
